  # LinkedIn's v2 API adherence to the documentation is shaky at best. Several of
  # the calls simply don't work if you, e.g., pass the URN in as a path element
  # for a resource - you have to use the ids=[URN] format w/ a single URN. Or
  # sometimes passing in an "actor" parameter in the request body simply doesn't
  # work, and you have to pass it in as a URL parameter. What you see in this
  # file is the result of trial-and-error getting these endpoints to work, and the
  # inconsistency is usually a result of either misunderstanding the docs or the
  # API not working as advertised. It's also a bit unclear when the API wants
  # an activity URN vs, e.g., an article URN. Caveat emptor.
